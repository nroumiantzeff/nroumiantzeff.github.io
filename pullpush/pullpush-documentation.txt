pullpush.js:
Pull Push Functional Reactive Programing engine

Main contribution:
You write an application using the usual procedural or functional programming (the pull phase) and the pullpush.js engine takes care of the reactive part automatically (the push pahse).

What is pullpush.js and what it is not:
- pullpush.js is not a language, it is ment to be used by JavaScript applications
- pullpush.js is not a transpiler, every thing is plain JavaScript and the engine does its things at runtime (note that you may use any JavaScript transpiler if you whish)
- pullpush.js is not a framwork but it comes with the "minimo" demo framework and other frameworks may be developed (framworks interact with the DOM)
- pullpush.js is not a JavaScript library but it comes with the "minimo" demo library and other libraries may be developed (libraries do not interact with the DOM)
- pullpush.js is not a super-set of the DOM, it does not more than the DOM but it does differently (the pullpush framework actually does less than the DOM but it provides an easy way to add missing pieces)
- pullpush.js is not a cross-browser compatibility tool, it actually runs on a limited number of browser versions (ES6)
- pullpush.js is not an architecture (such as the two-way-binding architecture or the Elm architecture), it is a new way of programming (such as structured programming or object-oriented programming)
- pullpush.js is not an API, it exposes a single function, "pullpush" for writing applications (and a dozen other functions to develop libraries and frameworks)
- pullpush.js is not about new concepts, it is based on two existing simple concepts, "source" and "sink" (and a third concept for libraries and frameworks, "observers")
- pullpush.js is not about special flow continuation such as CPS, it only uses standard function return but note that try/catch is supported
- pullpush.js is not about procedural vs functional programming, as pullpush.js supports both although its intends to promote pure functional programming
- pullpush.js is not about category theory but libraries build on top of pullpush.js also provide higher-order functions which combine functions (sources) in a "point-less" way independent on function arguments (notably the sink) and function returned value (source value)
- pullpush.js is not a type system but comments with source argument and value types are recommanded has they help reasoning when combining sources and other functions  (note that you may use any JavaScript type checker if you whish)
- pullpush.js is not about streams, you typically use a single value, the current value
- pullpush.js is not an immutability library, but you might consider using one when dealing with complex structured data since pullpush.js detects changes based on stric reference equality
- pullpush.js is not strictly side-effectless, values mutate but you cannot access the modified value (within the same JavaScript event queue tick)
- pullpush.js is not about pull vs push tradeoff, pullpush.js implements both pull and push in a efficient synergy
- pullpush.js is not about behaviours (continuous) vs events (discrete), it deals with both with a unified implementation
- pullpush.js is not about async vs callbacks, you program as sources where synchronous although they are typically asynchronous
- pullpush.js is not radioactive.js, although the approach is the closest you can find on the net when searching for Functional Reactive Programming, the implementation and formalism are quite different

function pullpush(sink, source, ...args): connects a source to a sink
- sink: a sink typically provided by the framework or by the source caller
	it is a function that you may call with an id as single argument to explicitely generate a sub-sink (note that most of the time pullpush automatically generates sub-sinks)
- source: implements a source typically provided by the framework or implemented as part of the application
	it is a function taking a sink as first argument and the spread args as other arguments
	alternatively, the source argument may be of a type other than "function" for declaration purpose, in that case it is converted to boolean (true/false to allow/prevent the automatic deletion of the corresponding sub-sink in case it is not used during the current javascript event queue tick)

Example:
	function functionalReactiveFibonacci(sink){
		// note: input is provided by the minimo framework, it generates a source from a DOM input element
		// note: click is provided by the minimo framework, it generates a source from a DOM button element
		// note: trigger is provided by the minimo library, it generates a source from a source with a value true when the original source value changes
		if(pullpush(sink, trigger(click("next")))){
			let v3 = pullpush(sink, input("v3"));
			let v2 = pullpush(sink, input("v2"), v3);
			let v1 = pullpush(sink, input("v1"), v2);
			return v1 + v2;
		}
		let v1 = pullpush(sink, input("v1")) || 0); // first Fibonacci number
		let v2 = pullpush(sink, input("v2")) || 1); // second Fibonacci number
		pullpush(sink, input("v3"), v1 + v2);
	}
	// the above reactive, pure function corresponds to the following non-reactive function below: 
 	function nonReactiveFibonacci(){
		let v1 = document.getElementById("v1").value || 0; // first Fibonacci number
		let v2 = document.getElementById("v2").value || 1; // second Fibonacci number
		document.getElementById("v3").value = v1 + v2;
	}
	// ...and to the following non-functional function below: 
 	function nonFunctionalFibonacci(){
		document.getElementById("v1").onchange = document.getElementById("v2").onchange = function(){
			let v1 = document.getElementById("v1").value || 0; // first Fibonacci number
			let v2 = document.getElementById("v2").value || 1; // second Fibonacci number
			document.getElementById("v3").value = v1 + v2;
		};
		document.getElementById("next").onclick = function(){
			let v2 = document.getElementById("v2").value || 1;
			document.getElementById("v1").value = v2;
			let v3 = document.getElementById("v3").value || 1;
			document.getElementById("v2").value = v3;
			document.getElementById("v3").value = v2 + v3;
		}
	}

List of functions available from pullpush.js to build libraries and frameworks:
- pullpush.sink(): the top level sink
- pullpush.forcast(sink, value, delay, source, ...args): specifies the sink value at a future time (the nearest future corresponds to the next JavaScript event queue tick). note: either value or source is specified (theother one must be equal to undefined)
- pullpush.broadcast(sink, observers, value): specifies the sink value at observers.
- pullpush.event(event, observers, value): updates the observers declared using pullpush.register after occurence of a DOM event
- pullpush.register(sink, observers, register, unregister): declare a sink as observer, optionaly specifying register and unregister handlers  
- pullpush.registered(sink, observers): checks whether a sink has been registered using pullpush.register
- pullpush.value(sink, defaultValue): the sink current value or defaultValue in case the value is undefined (typically when the sink has just been generated)
- pullpush.time(sink): the sink time (relative to the sink generation)
